## Rozsa Language Processor

Enhances configuration-based solutions by enabling the use of **dynamic configurations** instead of relying solely on
static data.

The Language Processor also functions as a **template engine**, capable of parsing entire files and evaluating language
expressions where needed.

Additionally, the Language Processor can also be extended with **custom functions** which will trigger the registered
java methods and with an entire new **vocabulary** to be used in the language expressions.
