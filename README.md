## Rozsa Template Processor

Enhances configuration-based solutions by enabling the use of **dynamic configurations** instead of relying solely on
static data.

The Template Processor can function as a **template engine**, capable of parsing entire files and evaluating language
expressions where needed, or as a stand-alone expressions' processor, when you need to provide dynamic values for
specific configuration fields.

Additionally, the Template Processor can also be extended with **custom functions** which will trigger the registered
java methods and with an entire new **vocabulary** to be used in the language expressions.
